# > List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.
# > Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.

# > For example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:
x, squares = 0, []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)

print(squares, x) # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 9

# > Note that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named x that still exists after the loop completes.
# > We can calculate the list of squares without any side effects using:
x, squares = 0, list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, range(10)))
print(squares, x) # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 0

# > or, equivalently:
x, squares = 1, [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares, x) # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] 1

# > which is more concise and readable.


# > A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses.
# > The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it.
#  For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not equal:
print([(x, y) for x in [1, 2, 3] for y in [3, 1, 4] if x != y]) # [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]

# > and itâ€™s equivalent to:
combs = []
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    for y in [3, 1, 4]:
        if x != y:
            combs.append((x, y))

print(combs) # [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]

# > Note how the order of the for and if statements is the same in both these snippets.

# > If the expression is a tuple (e.g. the (x, y) in the previous example), it must be parenthesized.
vec = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]
# create a new list with the values doubled
print([x * 2 for x in vec]) # [-8, -4, 0, 4, 8]
# filter the list to exclude negative numbers
print([x for x in vec if x >= 0]) # [0, 2, 4]
# apply a function to all the elements
print([abs(x) for x in vec]) # [4, 2, 0, 2, 4]
# call a method on each element
freshfruit = [' banana', ' loganberry', 'passion fruit ']
print([weapon.strip() for weapon in freshfruit]) # ['banana', 'loganberry', 'passion fruit']
# create a list of 2-tuples like (number, square)
print([(x, x ** 2) for x in range(6)]) # [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)]
# the tuple must be parenthesized, otherwise an error is raised
#print([x, x ** 2 for x in range(6)])
#  File "app.py", line 55
#    print([x, x ** 2 for x in range(6)])

# flatten a list using a listcomp with two 'for'

print([num for elem in vec for num in elem]) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# > List comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested functions:
